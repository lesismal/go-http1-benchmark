# with script/killall.sh, and use BENCH_FRAMEWORKS below if the idle ones
# holding memory would disturb the framework being measured. And each node
# gives the whole machine to its own half, since there is no longer anything

# pin it where a node shares its CPUs with something else.

#              pipelines requests at a rate the clients set rather than to

#              same row in every table and across runs, whatever it scored, so
#              two reports can be diffed. Only the Go list reaches a report;
#              the frameworks array below decides what is built and run, and is
#              kept in the same order so that the two read alike
#
# In either order every ranked column - TPS, CPU EER and MEM EER - shows each
# row's share of the best in that column after it, the best being 100%, and
# carries [↓1], [↓2] or [↓3] after its title for which key it is. Rows that tie keep the
# framework order between them, so two frameworks that scored the same - or a
# whole table from a benchmark that did not run, which leaves every row at
# zero - come out the same way on every run.
