# go-http-benchmark

HTTP/1.1 server benchmark for Go frameworks, with Rust's axum and C++'s
workflow as references, built the same way as
[go-websocket-benchmark](https://github.com/lesismal/go-websocket-benchmark):
the same scripts, the same Go client structure, and the same report format.

| Framework | Package | Server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `axum` | [github.com/tokio-rs/axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) (Rust) | `axum::serve` on tokio's multi-threaded runtime, one listener per port, one worker thread per CPU the process may run on |
| `beego` | [github.com/beego/beego/v2](https://github.com/beego/beego) (formerly `github.com/astaxie/beego`) | `web.NewControllerRegister()` on beego's default config (prod mode, no sessions, no gzip) on `net/http` |
| `chi` | [github.com/go-chi/chi/v5](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) | `chi.NewRouter()` (no middleware) on `net/http` |
| `echo` | [github.com/labstack/echo/v5](https://github.com/labstack/echo) | `echo.New()` (no middleware) on `net/http` |
| `fasthttp` | [github.com/valyala/fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) | one `fasthttp.Server` serving every port |

| `gorillamux` | [github.com/gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) | `mux.NewRouter()` on `net/http` |
| `hertz` | [github.com/cloudwego/hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz) | `server.New()` (no middleware) on its [netpoll](https://github.com/cloudwego/netpoll) transport, one engine per port, all sharing netpoll's pollers |
| `httprouter` | [github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) | `httprouter.New()` on `net/http` |
| `nbio` | [github.com/lesismal/nbio](https://github.com/lesismal/nbio) | one `nbhttp.Engine` bound to every port, `IOModNonBlocking` (every connection on nbio's pollers), serving the same `net/http` handler as `nethttp` |
| `nethttp` | `net/http` | one `http.Server` per port, all sharing one `ServeMux` |
| `workflow` | [github.com/sogou/workflow](https://github.com/sogou/workflow) (C++) | its HTTP server benchmark, [`benchmark-01-http_server.cc`](https://github.com/sogou/workflow/blob/master/benchmark/benchmark-01-http_server.cc), answering with the request body: one `WFHttpServer` per port, one poller thread per CPU the process may run on, workflow's default 20 handler threads |

The servers built on `net/http` each run one `http.Server` per port, all on
the framework's one router, and read the request body into a pooled buffer
the same way. `chi`, `goji`, `gorillamux` and `httprouter` route `/echo` to
the same `net/http` handler as `nethttp`, so among those the numbers differ by
the router alone; `beego`, `echo` and `gin` write the response through their
own context.

Every server answers `POST /echo` with the request body, byte for byte, with a
`Content-Length`. Each one listens on 50 ports (see `config.Ports`) so that a
client dialing a million connections from one address does not run out of
ephemeral ports toward any one port. `/init`, `/ps` and `/debug/pprof/` are on
a separate `net/http` server on the port after the last benchmark port. That
way the framework being measured serves nothing but `/echo`, and control
requests never wait behind benchmark requests.

`axum` is a Rust program in [`frameworks/axum`](frameworks/axum), so it cannot
share the Go servers' control server. It serves `/init` and `/ps` itself, on
its own control port, in the same JSON shape (only the `cpu` and `mem[].rss`
fields, which are all the clients read). It has no `/debug/pprof/`; the
clients fetch pprof profiles only from Go servers, so an axum run has none. It
takes the same `-nodelay`, `-reuseport` and `-b` flags; `-m` is accepted and
ignored, since Rust has no GC to limit. Its port range is a constant in
`src/main.rs`, which a test in `config` holds to `config.Ports`.

`workflow` is a C++ program in [`frameworks/workflow`](frameworks/workflow),
and is set up the same way as axum: it serves `/init` and `/ps` itself on its
control port, has no `/debug/pprof/`, takes the same flags with `-m` ignored,
and carries its port range as a constant in `main.cc` that a test holds to
`config.Ports`. The server is workflow's own benchmark server with one
change: it answers with the request body rather than a fixed string, since
the clients check the body. It also lifts three of workflow's per-server
defaults that a Go server does not have, so that they do not decide a run:
the 2000-connection limit, the 10s write timeout, and the 60s idle keep-alive
timeout, which goes to workflow's maximum of 300s. [`build.sh`](frameworks/workflow/build.sh)
builds workflow v1.1.0 from source, as a static library, and needs git,
cmake, a C++ compiler and OpenSSL's headers.

workflow's server does not support HTTP pipelining: data arriving on a
connection before the server has answered the request in front of it closes
the connection (`Communicator::create_request` fails with `EBADMSG`). So both
clients skip `BenchPipeline` for it (`config.NoPipeline`) and write a report
marked `Skipped` instead. Its row stays in the `BenchPipeline` table, with
`-` in every column but `Framework` and `Lang`, after every measured row, and
takes no part in the Summary.

## What is measured

The benchmark client runs three benchmarks one after another on the same
keep-alive connections. There are two clients, which run them the same way
(see [Benchmark client](#benchmark-client)):

| Benchmark | What it does | TPS is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Connections` | dials `-c` TCP connections, `-dc` at a time, and sends one `GET /echo` on each | connections established and answered per second |
| `BenchEcho` | `-en` request/response round trips: a `POST /echo` with `-b` random bytes, then the response is read back, with one request in flight per connection and `-ec` connections busy at once | round trips per second |
| `BenchPipeline` | HTTP/1.1 pipelining for `-rd` seconds: each connection gets `-rr` requests a second, written in batches of `-rpl` requests (or, with `-rpl=0`, as many as fit in `-rbs` bytes) without waiting for earlier responses; a goroutine per connection reads the responses | responses read back per second |

`Connections` sends a request on each connection because an HTTP server has no
handshake of its own, and a connection the kernel accepted is not yet one the
server is serving. That GET is the equivalent of the WebSocket upgrade.

`BenchPipeline` limits each connection to four unanswered batches. When the server
falls behind the rate, the client skips that connection for a tick instead of
queueing more requests, so a slow server is measured by what it answered, not
by how deep a backlog the client built. When the duration is up, the client
waits up to one more tick for the last batch, then counts. `Rate Pipeline` in
the Summary table is the number of requests merged into one write. Set it with
`-rpl`, which has to divide `-rr` so that the batch goes out a whole number of
times a second. The default, `-rpl=0`, uses the most requests that fit in
`-rbs` bytes (16KB) and divide `-rr`, which is 10 for the default 1KB payload
and 200 requests a second:

```sh
bash script/benchmark.sh -rr=200 -rpl=50   # 50 requests per write, 4 writes a second
```

The client writes pre-encoded requests and parses responses with a small
reader ([`protocol`](benchcli-go/protocol/http.go)) instead of `net/http`'s
client. On a single-node run, whatever the client spends on each request
comes out of the machine the server runs on. `-check=true` compares every
response body with the request that was sent.

## Benchmark client

`script/config.sh` selects the client with `BENCH_CLIENT`:

| `BENCH_CLIENT` | client | Summary `Client` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `benchcli-rust` (default) | [`benchcli-rust`](benchcli-rust): Rust, on [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), the runtime [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) runs on; needs cargo | `rust-tokio` |
| `benchcli-go` | [`benchcli-go`](benchcli-go): Go, goroutines on `net` | `go-net` |

```sh
BENCH_CLIENT=benchcli-go bash script/benchmark.sh
```

Both clients take the same flags, run the same three benchmarks the same way,
and write the same JSON report files. `benchcli-rust` computes TPS, latencies,
percentiles and the CPU/MEM columns exactly as perf does for the Go client,
and samples the server the same way, locally or over `/init` and `/ps`. Tests
in `config` and `report` keep its framework table and report field names in
step with the Go definitions.

The report step is the Go client's in either case: `script/build.sh` always
builds it as `output/bin/bench.report`, and `script/report.sh` runs that on
whatever the measuring client wrote. That gives one report format with one
implementation.

Neither client uses an HTTP client library. axum is a server framework with
no client of its own, and hyper's client, which axum is built on, sends one
request at a time on a connection, so it could not run `BenchPipeline`.
`benchcli-rust` speaks HTTP/1.1 over tokio's TCP the way `benchcli-go` does
over Go's. The `-el` and `-rl` limits allow that many requests per second
there, which is what their usage text says.

`CPU EER` is throughput per percent of a CPU core: `TPS / CPU Avg`. `MEM EER`
is throughput per MB (2^20 bytes, the `M` the MEM columns show) of the
server's average memory: `TPS / MEM Avg`. The server's CPU and memory are
sampled every `-pi` ms. `-ps=auto` (the default) samples the server process
from the client side when it runs on the same machine, and asks the server's
`/ps` route when it does not; `local` and `remote` force one or the other. A
phase shorter than one sampling interval has no samples, and its CPU, MEM,
CPU EER and MEM EER columns read 0. The client logs a message when that
happens.

## Run

Go 1.27 or later, a Rust toolchain (cargo 1.85 or later; see
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)) for the default client, `benchcli-rust`, and
for the `axum` server, and git, cmake, a C++ compiler and OpenSSL (on Debian,
`apt install git cmake g++ libssl-dev`; on macOS, `brew install cmake openssl`)
for the `workflow` server. Without them, use the Go client and leave axum and
workflow out:
`BENCH_CLIENT=benchcli-go BENCH_FRAMEWORKS=beego,chi,echo,fasthttp,fib,fiber,gin,goji,gorillamux,hertz,httprouter,nbio,nethttp`. From the
repository root:

```sh
# all frameworks, 10k connections, 1k payload
bash script/benchmark.sh

# a subset, with client flags
BENCH_FRAMEWORKS=fasthttp,fib bash script/benchmark.sh -c=10000 -en=2000000 -b=1024

# every framework through the Connections x BodySize x BenchTime matrix in script/config.sh
bash script/benchmarkN.sh

# 1m connections (needs the system settings below)
bash script/1m_conns_benchmark.sh
```

Change the defaults in [`script/config.sh`](script/config.sh). Reports are
written to `output/report`: one JSON file per framework and benchmark, plus
`Summary.md`, `Connections.md`, `BenchEcho.md` and `BenchPipeline.md`. Server logs
are in `output/log`. `benchmark.sh` forwards only `-nodelay`, `-reuseport`,
`-b` and `-m` to the servers. Every other flag goes to the client; run
`go run ./benchcli-go -h` for the list.

Only one server runs at a time. Each framework's server is started right
before its turn. Its client starts one second after the server listens on all
of its ports. The server is stopped as soon as the client is done, and the
next framework waits for it to exit. The run then pauses for `SleepTime`
seconds (in `script/config.sh`) before the next framework, but not after the
last one.

On Linux, `script/env.sh` pins the servers and the client to separate halves
of the CPUs with `taskset`, and splits by socket, NUMA node or core when
`lscpu` can tell them apart. Without `taskset` (macOS, for example), nothing is
pinned.

### Docker

The Docker runner reads the CPU set and memory exposed by the Docker daemon,
uses about 75% of its CPUs and 80% of its memory, pins separate CPU groups for
the servers and the client, and copies reports, logs, console output and the
resource plan to `output/docker/<timestamp>`.

```sh
# short nethttp-only validation
bash script/docker_benchmark.sh --smoke

# full benchmark
bash script/docker_benchmark.sh

# focused run with explicit resource limits
BENCH_FRAMEWORKS=fasthttp,fib \
DOCKER_BENCH_CPUS=8 DOCKER_BENCH_MEMORY=12g \
bash script/docker_benchmark.sh -c=10000 -en=2000000 -b=1024

# 8 CPUs for the container: 2 pinned to the servers, 6 to the client
bash script/docker_benchmark.sh -cput=8 -cpus=2 -cpuc=6
```

`-cput`, `-cpus` and `-cpuc` work the same with `script/docker_benchmark_cn.sh`.

`-socketsyscalls=false` has the fib server read and write its sockets with
`read`, `write` and `writev` instead of fib's default `recvfrom`, `sendto` and
`sendmsg` (`fib.Config.SocketSyscalls`, Linux only); `-socketsyscalls=true`,
the default, keeps them. It is `BENCH_FIB_SOCKET_SYSCALLS` in
`script/config.sh`, and works the same with `script/benchmark.sh`,
`script/benchmarkN.sh`, `script/1m_conns_benchmark.sh` and every
`script/docker_*benchmark*.sh`; no other server is given it.

Run `bash script/docker_benchmark.sh --help` for all overrides. From mainland
China, use `script/docker_benchmark_cn.sh` instead. It takes the same options
and builds the image from mirrors (DaoCloud for Docker Hub, Aliyun for apt,
goproxy.cn for Go modules, rsproxy.cn for crates.io, Gitee for workflow).
Only the build downloads anything, and the benchmark itself runs with
`--network none`: the image carries the Rust toolchain and has axum's
dependencies and the workflow library compiled, so building axum and workflow
in the container needs no network.

The [Docker benchmark workflow](.github/workflows/docker-benchmark.yml) runs
the same script on every push to `main`, or by hand from the Actions tab, and
writes the tables to the job summary. The container gets 8 CPUs when the
runner has at least 8, and 4 otherwise, so every CI run is one of those two
sizes. The standard GitHub-hosted runner has 4 CPUs; to get 8, set the
repository variable `DOCKER_BENCH_RUNNER` to the label of a larger runner. A
runner with fewer than 4 CPUs fails the job.

## Report format

The reports have the same layout as go-websocket-benchmark's: a Summary table
of the run's parameters, each with a description of what it means and the
flag that sets it, then one table per benchmark. The Summary's first row,
`Project`, names the benchmark: `GO-HTTP1-BENCHMARK`.

- `Lang`, right after `Framework`, is the language the framework's server is
  written in (`go`, `rust`, `c++`), from `config.Langs`.
- Rows are ranked best first by `TPS`. In `BenchEcho` and `BenchPipeline`, a tie
  is broken by `CPU EER`, and a tie on that too by `MEM EER`. The ranked
  columns carry `[↓1]`, `[↓2]` and `[↓3]` in their titles.
- Every ranked column shows each row's share of the best value in that
  column, floored so that only the best row reads `100%`.
- Parameters shared by every row (`Client`, `Conns`, `Payload`, each
  benchmark's concurrency, `Echo Total`, `Rate Duration`, `Rate SendRate`,
  `Rate Pipeline`, and `Echo Pprof` / `Rate Pprof`, whether the client
  fetched Go servers' pprof profiles, `-ep` / `-rp`) are in the Summary table
  instead of the columns. A parameter the rows disagree on lists each value
  with its frameworks, for example `20000 (fib); 19998 (fasthttp)`.
- The JSON files keep every field, including `TP50`, `TP75`, `TP90`,
  `CPU Min` and `MEM Min`, which the tables leave out.

`BENCH_REPORT_SORT=framework` (or `-sort=framework`) keeps
`config.FrameworkList` order instead, so that a framework is on the same row
in every table and across runs. Neither order changes the numbers, so
re-running the report step alone is enough:

```sh
bash script/report.sh -sort=framework
```

## Two nodes

To run the servers and the client on separate machines, set `BENCH_ROLE` on
each and give the client side the server's address. The servers bind every
interface, so nothing needs configuring on their side.

```sh
# On the server node: builds the servers, starts them, leaves them running.
BENCH_ROLE=server bash script/benchmark.sh

# On the client node: builds the client, runs it against the servers, reports.
BENCH_ROLE=client BENCH_SERVER_HOST=10.0.0.2 bash script/benchmark.sh

# Back on the server node, when the run is over.
bash script/killall.sh
```

A node that runs one half gets the whole machine. The client cannot stop
servers it did not start, so every server stays up for the whole run. Use
`BENCH_FRAMEWORKS` to run a subset if the idle servers would disturb the one
being measured. The CPU and MEM columns come from the servers' own `/ps`
route, because the client cannot see the server process from another machine.

## Before running the test

Set the system limits on every machine the benchmark runs on. The client node
needs the port range and file descriptor limits as much as the server does:

```sh
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65535"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_reserved_ports=10001-11451
sysctl -w fs.file-max=2000500
sysctl -w fs.nr_open=2000500
sysctl -w net.nf_conntrack_max=2000500
ulimit -n 2000500
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem='131072  262144  524288'
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem='8760  256960  4088000'
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem='8760  256960  4088000'
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16384
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16384
sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=2048
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=2048
sysctl -w /proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog=2048
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1
```

`ip_local_reserved_ports` keeps the servers' ports, every framework's range in
`config.Ports` plus its control port, out of the client's ephemeral ports.
Each server starts only for its own turn. Without the reservation, the
connections of earlier runs, and the TIME_WAIT sockets they leave behind, can
hold a later server's ports, and it exits with "address already in use".
`docker_benchmark.sh` sets both port settings in the container itself.

## Sample results

These numbers are from `bash script/docker_benchmark.sh` with the defaults, on
Docker Desktop on an Apple M4 Pro. Docker had 10 CPUs; the run allocated 7:
3 for the servers and 4 for the client. They show what the report looks like.
They are not a reference measurement: re-run on your own hardware.
